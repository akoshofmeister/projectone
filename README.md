This is a university project by Máté Molnár and Ákos Hofmeister for ELTE Faculty Of Informatics.

Our project is about updating images. Everybody can upload an image to different rooms and can reply to a post with text or image. You can't post only text to a room, it have to conatins at least one image (multiple images are supported too). Every post goes through a moderation process in where the room's administrator can acces or deny the post.

After registration you are member only of the global room. You can create a room anytime you want, and you can invite people by their username, given during registration. You can also accept or deny any incoming invitation, and you can block people, so you won't see their messages and they can't invite you to rooms.

After registration your rank is User, so you can open only 1 room and invite only 5 people. After uploading several images and get others to reply on it, you will be promoted with several interesting features.
