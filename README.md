# Project One
This is a university project by Máté Molnár and Ákos Hofmeister for ELTE Faculty Of Informatics.

Our project is about uploading images. Everybody can upload an image to different rooms and can reply to a post with
text or image. You can't post only text to a room, it has to contain at least one image 
(multiple images are supported too). 

After registration you only have access to the Global room. You can create a room anytime you want, and you can invite 
people by their username. You can also accept or deny any incoming invitation, and you can block people, so you won't 
see their messages and they can't invite you to rooms.

Freshly registered users start off with the User rank. After uploading several images and get others to reply on it, 
you will be awarded with several interesting features as your rank increases.
